## 3. Getting Started ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

To get a local copy of this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rancha124/youtube-clone.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project

Change your working directory to the project folder:

```sh
cd youtube-clone
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using npm:

```sh
npm i
```
#### 4. API KEY Setup

To fetch YouTube data, you'll need the following `API_KEYS`. Follow these steps to set them up:

1. Obtain a **YouTube API key from Google** by visiting [Google Developers - Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). If you need detailed instructions, you can also refer to [How to Get a YouTube API Key](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key).
2. Get a YouTube V3 API key from [Rapid API - YouTube V3](https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31). If you haven't used Rapid API before, you'll need to sign up after signup subscribe to the **YouTube V3 API** for free.

Once you have your API keys, proceed with the following:

3. Create a `.env` file in the `root` directory of your project.
4. Place your API key values in the `.env` file as shown below. 

```sh
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_GOOGLE=YOUR_API_KEY
REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_RAPIDAPI=YOUR_API_KEY
```

> Note :- The `REACT_APP` prefix is used to define environment variables in a React application. These variables are used during the build process and can be accessed in your code using `process.env.REACT_APP_VARIABLE_NAME`.


#### 5. Start the Project

Run the following command to launch the ReactJS project in your local environment:

```sh
npm start
```

#### 6. Access the Project

Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project.

That's it! Happy coding! üöÄ


## 4. Understand Context API üß† 

`YoutubeContext.js` module is created to streamline the handling of YouTube data within your React application. It utilizes React's Context API to establish a centralized state and methods, making it easier to manage and fetch YouTube-related information.

Key Features:

- Retrieve popular videos based on the country code.
- Provide auto-complete suggestions for search queries.
- Get search results for user-entered video queries.
- Manage API calls and loading states efficiently.
- To support mobile screen compatibility lacking in the initial API, 
I've integrated a secondary API for generating autocomplete suggestions. Although the first API has unlimited access on desktop, I opted to utilize both due to these differences.
- In functions such as getSearchVideos and getTrendingVideo, I've integrated the second API as a backup. This setup ensures uninterrupted service by seamlessly shifting to the second API when the first one reaches its usage limit. This strategy boosts application reliability and offers users a smoother experience.
